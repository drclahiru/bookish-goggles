Using ; in the end of a function to avoid ambiguity (optional)
if's end in end-if
Might want to use brackets to avoid ambiguity when functions are called e.g.
(fun1 param1) + (fun2 param2)
Recursion done using pattern matching.
Operators 
+ , - , * , / , ++ (concat) 
might want to replace the : with = 
or some other sign but i use : to avoid ambiguity
also the ; can be replaced/removed too
using parantheses like in lisp is also understandable by me.
